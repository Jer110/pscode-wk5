//Exercise 1: I'm using javaScipt to define the variables
var num1 = 5
var num2 = 2 

// the equation to add the intergers 
var sum = num1 + num2 

//I am telling the console to print the sum of the two variables 
console.log('The sum is:' + sum)

//Exercise 2: using javascript, if a number is a percent of 2 with a zero remainder then it's odd, otherwise it's even
if(number % 2==0){
    //the number is even
}
else {

    //The number is odd 
}

If r==0, print "even"
if r!=0, print "odd"

//Exercise 3a: I had to research how to find the average for an array in javaScript, I found jsowl.com that gave me this example. 

var myArray = [1,2,3,4,5]

const sum = myArray.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

const average = (sum / myArray.length) || 0;

console.log('The sum is: ${sum}. The average is: ${average}.)
// The sum is: 15. The average is: 3.
//I told the computer to print the average to the console. 
//I have done some javascript with codecademy and The Odin Project previously so using javascript was the best way I could think to do this project. 

//Exercise 3b:I used javascript to find the minimum and maximum numbers in my array, 

var array = [1,2,3,4,5];

let minValue = Math.min(array);
let maxValue = Math.max(array);

console.log("Minimum value is:" + 'minValue'.);
Console.log("Maximum value is:" + 'maxValue'.);

// "Minimum value is: 1. Maximum value is: 5. 
// I used ws3docs, geeksforgeeks.org, and mdn webdocs to help create this.
